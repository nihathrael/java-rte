\section{Future plans}
Polarity measures could be implemented as a sort of filter around normal matchers, which can be added on demand.
Currently the polarity is used in all \textit{BasicMatchers}.

There are probably a lot of interesting possibilities with the WordNet API which have not been explored yet. Combining
these with a more tuned version of the Mahout learning algorithms might lead to better results in the future.

The code could be better documented using javadoc. We think that if the code is properly documented it could be released as a generic RTE java library that can be used by
others for their work. All code can be found at: \url{https://github.com/nihathrael/java-rte}
