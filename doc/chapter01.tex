\subsection{Basic framework}

- all systems of all parts in one test environment

- own evaluation implementation to improve performance

\subsection{Systems in part 1}
\subsection{Systems in part 2}
\subsection{Systems in part 3}
For part 3 we implemented a learning algorithm provided by the Mahout\footnote{Mahout website:
\url{http://mahout.apache.org/}} library. Mahout is a powerful and scalable machine learning library, providing
algorithms for recommendations, clustering, and classification.

We implemented the \textit{BasicMahoutMatcher} by using
the \textit{OnlineLogisticRegression} algorithm. The results were not very promising at first and it is fairly easy to
get really bad results from the machine learner if the parameters are not correctly set or the wrong features are
selected. The following features are used for the \textit{BasicMahoutMatcher}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Lemma Matching
    \item IDF Lemma Matching
    \item Lemma+POS Matching
    \item BleuScore
    \item 2-Gram Overlap
\end{itemize}

The resulting score is not very good, as no semantic information and almost no structural information is used. The
\textit{BasicMahoutMatcher} scores ~56.4\%.

\subsubsection{Evaluating the Machine Learner}
We implemented a 10-fold cross-validation to verify if our changes to the features improved the matcher or made the
results worse. The code for this can be found in the \textit{Main} class under the function name
\textit{crossValidate(ArrayList<THPair> pairs, IMachineLearnerRecognizer mlearner)}.
